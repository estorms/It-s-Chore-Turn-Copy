 <h4>What We Do</h4>
        <p>It's CHORE Turn!: The Divorce Alternative makes staying together easier-ish! To use, register your household, create your partner profiles, and enter your household's chores for a predetermined period of time. (We recommend a week.) </p> <p> Assign each chore a mutually agreeable number of "Irritation Points" on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being mildly annoying and 10 being about as much fun as a poke in the eye. </p>As you and your somewhat-loved one complete your chores, track them here. Every time you complete a chore, its Irritation Points will convert to your Points Earned. <p>When an unexpected chore comes up, we'll delegate it for you using the hard data you've given us, rather than your usual admixture of flawed logic, latent hostility, and bias. Then, when you're ready, reset your points and start a fresh round.</p>
